PART 1: FILE HANDLING & DATA PERSISTENCE
-------------------------------------------

Level 1: Understanding Files - Why We Need Them
-----------------------------------------------------------
Explaining Points:

File = Permanent storage (data survives program restart)
Memory (variables) = Temporary (lost when program ends)
Banking Need: Transaction logs, account data, settlement files
File Types: Text files (.txt, .csv, .json, .log)


Level 2: Basic File Operations - Read and Write
-----------------------------------------------------------
Explaining Points:

Open modes: 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'a' (append)
'w' mode: Overwrites existing file
'a' mode: Adds to end of file
Always use with: Automatic file closing

# File Modes
# ==========

'r'  - Read only (file must exist)
'w'  - Write (creates new file, overwrites if exists)
'a'  - Append (adds to end, creates if doesn't exist)
'r+' - Read and write
'w+' - Write and read (overwrites)
'a+' - Append and read


Level 3: Working with CSV Files - Structured Data
-----------------------------------------------------------
Explaining Points:

CSV = Comma-Separated Values
Standard format for tabular data
Python's csv module = Easy reading/writing
Banking use: Account lists, transaction reports, settlement files


Level 4: Working with JSON Files - Complex Data
-----------------------------------------------------------
Explaining Points:

JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
Human-readable format
Perfect for: Nested data, configurations, API responses
Python dict ↔ JSON conversion
