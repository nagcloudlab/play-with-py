Level 1: Understanding Errors - What Goes Wrong?
-------------------------------------------------
Explaining Points:

Error = Something unexpected happens in code
Crash = Program stops completely (BAD for banking!)
Exception Handling = Catch errors and handle gracefully
Real NPCI Problem: Payment fails but system should continue


Defensive Programming & Error Management Patterns
--------------------------------------------------

Key Points
---------

Retry logic
Fallback values
Graceful degradation
Validations to prevent exceptions
Avoiding bare except

---------------------------------------------

Exception vs Error
----------------------

Exceptions are events that occur during program execution 
that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. 

- ValueError
- TyepeError
- IndexError


Errors are a type of exception that indicates a serious problem 
that a program should not try to handle.

- SyntaxError
- MemoryError
- SystemError
- RecursionError


---------------------------------------------

Best Practices Checklist
---------------------------------------------

Key Points

Be specific with except
Don’t hide errors
Don’t overuse exceptions for logic
Validate inputs early
Use custom exceptions where meaningful
Cleanup using finally
Use logging, not print
Let fatal errors propagate

Exception Handling & Error Management
---------------------------------------------

Use exceptions for expected, recoverable issues; errors for critical failures.
Structure code cleanly using try / except / else / finally.
Create custom exceptions for domain clarity.
Use logging and exception chaining for traceability.
Never swallow exceptions silently (avoid except:).
Validate inputs to reduce exceptions proactively.
Write defensive, resilient production systems using retries, fallbacks, and cleanup.

Level 1: The Problem - Why Context Managers?
Explaining Points:

Problem: Forgetting to cleanup resources (files, connections, locks)
Context Manager = Automatic setup and cleanup
'with' statement = Python's solution
Critical in Banking: Must close files, unlock accounts, release connections


Level 2: Context Managers - The Elegant SolutionExplaining Points:
---------------------------------------------

with statement = Automatic setup and cleanup
Python handles the try-finally for you
Cleaner, safer code
Standard way to manage resources



Level 4: Context Managers with contextlib (Function-based)
---------------------------------------------
Explaining Points:

@contextmanager decorator = Create context manager from function
Simpler than class-based approach
Use yield to separate setup and cleanup
Perfect for quick context managers
